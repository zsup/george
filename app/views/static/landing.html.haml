				%h1 Painless set-up and oh so easy to use.
				%p It's easy to set up your SWITCH Sockets. Simply plug one into every standard lightbulb socket that you want to control, and connect any normal lightbulb. Use our smartphone app to connect the sockets to Wi-Fi, and you're ready to go.

				%h1 Control from your phone... or anywhere.
				%p Out of the box, your lights can already do so much more. You can control them from anywhere using your phone, tablet, or computer. Schedule your lights to replicate a timer while you're traveling, or use your lights as an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. Set up your lights to flash whenever you've got a new email or text message, so you're always connected. Oh, and did we mention that our sockets make your lights fully dimmable?* Time for some mood lighting...
				%p.footnote * Dimming requires an incandescent bulb, a dimmable CFL, or an LED lightbulb. Sorry, normal CFLs... you're just not ready for us.

				%h1 Apps make it even cooler.
				%p Developers can use our RESTful API to write apps that can interact with your lights. What does that mean for you? Soon any app can interact with your lights. Imagine that your lights got brighter when you're reading a book with an eBook reader, and dimmer when you're watching TV on Hulu. Imagine that your lights turn off automatically when you leave for work, and turn on automatically when you arrive home. Anything is possible when left to the imaginations of talented software developers.
